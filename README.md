A Chrome extension for GitHub's [Saved Replies](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-saved-replies/using-saved-replies) that adds replies from a repository's `.github/replies.yml`.

Saved Replies are great, but oftentimes repository maintainers need a way to share common replies per-repository.
This extension modifies the Saved Replies for issues on any repository with a `.github/replies.yml` file to include those replies.
